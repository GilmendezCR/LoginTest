Currently using:
selenium           ver.3.141.0
html-testRunner    ver.1.2.1
Chrome browser 	   ver.86.0.4240.111 (Official build) (64 bits)
Python             ver.3.9.0
OS used            ver.Windows 10

Commands for troubleshooting:
pip list: This will display all current packages installed
pip install selenium: This will intall selenium in case it is not installed
pip install html-testRunner: This will install the HTML reports


To utilize the unitesting module is really important to import it by using: import unittest
Note: In case you have problems with the driver path on line 11 please do right click on where the driver is(Chrome_Driver > chromedriver.exe)
and right click on it and copy the path. You can use absolute or relative. Personally I used relative.
When the automated test is finished this one will generate a HTML report. Reports >
